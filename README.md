# CareEase - Digital Health Project Management Case Study

## Executive Summary

CareEase is a structured digital health project management case study simulating the development of a caregiver companion app for dementia care. 

This project demonstrates end-to-end project lifecycle planning including risk prioritization (RPN scoring), budget variance tracking, stakeholder communication planning, and workflow modeling.

The focus was on translating healthcare requirements into measurable project governance, cost control, and risk mitigation strategies.
